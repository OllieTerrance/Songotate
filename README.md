Introduction
============

Songotate is an app that aims to provide a number of options for labelling up songs.  This labelling should result in metadata suitable for generating worlds in games.

The BPM and offset controls allow fitting in-game elements to the beat of the song.  Sections of the song can then be tagged according to their style, weight (i.e. a heavy beat/drop) and so on.

Dependencies
============

The app uses the HTML5 audio API, and expects jQuery [in a `lib` folder](https://github.com/OllieTerrance/Lib).
